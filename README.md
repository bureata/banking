# banking

A simple API for transactions made in a banking app. It's made with Python and Flask and has a lightweight UI provided by Swagger.

Since it is not hosted anywhere, you will have to clone the repository if you want to see it in action using Swagger.

The app needs a MongoDB Collection named "clients" inside a Database named "bankingDB".
You will also have to create a new file named "mongo_credentials.py". "mongo_credentials.py" file (marked in the .gitignore file as ingored) should contain the connection link (generated from MongoDB-Cluster-Connect section), stored in a variable named "pass_text".

At this point, I think it's simpler to just read the code. Thank you!
